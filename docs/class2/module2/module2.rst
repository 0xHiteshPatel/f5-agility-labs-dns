Listeners
############################################

A listener object is an spcialized virtual server that is configured to respond to DNS queries.

We will be creating both TCP and UDP based listeners that have the same IP address of the existing DNS server.

Note: the Windows workstation is configured to use 10.1.70.200 for DNS.
